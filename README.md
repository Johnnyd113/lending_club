# lending_club
Personal project to predict loan investment returns on the Lending Club platform.

This is a current work in progress. Main goals are to:
1. Build a ML model to select Lending Club loans to invest in and beat the average returns on LC loans
2. Create a product to auto invest on the LC platform through API calls
3. Explore areas of interest in the LC loan dataset
