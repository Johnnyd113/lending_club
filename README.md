# lending_club
Personal project to predict loan investment returns on the Lending Club platform.

This is a current work in progress. Main goals are to:
1. Build a ML model to select Lending Club loans to invest in and beat the average returns on LC loans
2. Create a product to auto invest on the LC platform through API calls
3. Explore areas of interest in the LC loan dataset

[API-how_to:](https://github.com/Johnnyd113/lending_club/blob/master/API-how_to.ipynb) Brief overview of how you can use your api key to access lendingclub data.

[prelim-clean.ipynb:](https://github.com/Johnnyd113/lending_club/blob/master/prelim_clean.ipynb) This notebook cleans data downloaded from lendingclub. You can enter your own api key and account info to interact with some of the data yourself. The notebook removes features that would not be available at time of investment, and adds features to later calculate annualized returns
