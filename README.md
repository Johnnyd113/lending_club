# lending_club
Personal project to predict loan investment returns on the Lending Club platform.

This is a current work in progress. Main goals are to:
1. Build a ML model to select Lending Club loans to invest in and beat the average returns on LC loans
2. Create a product to auto invest on the LC platform through API calls
3. Explore areas of interest in the LC loan dataset

[API-how_to:](https://github.com/Johnnyd113/lending_club/blob/master/API-how_to.ipynb) Brief overview of how you can use your api key to access lendingclub data.

Notebooks 1 to 7 take you thru each step to go from cleaning the data, training the model, evaluating on held out test data, and finally retraining on all data to predict returns on live loans
